Creates Solr cores for Drupal 8 websites.

This Ansible role will create and configure Apache Solr cores as required for the [Search API Solr](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api_solr) module.

Currently supports versions 8.x-1.x and 8.x-2.x of the Search API Solr module.

This is loosely based on the [Apache Solr](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-solr) role by [Jeff Geerling](https://www.jeffgeerling.com) and uses some of the same variables. It assumes you've set up Solr with that role, but can probably work if Solr was set up differently.

Set the drupal_solr_cores variable to add cores:

    drupal_solr_cores:
      - drupal1

Set the drupal_solr_version variable to set up configuration files from the Search API Solr module according to your Solr version.

    drupal_solr_version: 7.x

Support for Solr 7 with Search API Solr 8.x-2.x includes copying an initial configuration zip file generated by Search API Solr module. This role includes one, but overring that file is recommended by setting a custom path to your zip file in the drupal_solr_config_archive variable.

    drupal_solr_config_archive: /path/to/solr/config/file.zip

You may also need to override the path to your Solr installation for Solr 7 by customising the install path as per the Search API Solr installtion instructions. This role will make the necessary change to the solrcore.properties properties file. You may override the path with the solr_install_path variable.

    solr_install_path: "/opt/{{ solr_service_name }}"

See `defaults/main.yml` for all available variables.
